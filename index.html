            React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is
            maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and
            companies. React can be used as a base in the development of
            single-page or mobile applications.

        <h3>#1 React is not a framework</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Even professional React developers often say that React is a JavaScript framework. However, React’s official website describes it as “a JavaScript library for building user interfaces,” so who’s right? The short answer is that <strong>React is a JavaScript library</strong>, but the fact remains that it has several characteristics of a framework.

        <h3>#2 Virtual DOM is faster than real DOM</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
          All React developers sooner or later hear the term <strong>virtual DOM</strong> and wonder what it is and what advantages it offers compared to the real DOM (Document Object Model), which is a cross-platform and language-independent application programming interface that connects web pages to scripts or programming languages, making it possible for web developers to modify web pages with a scripting language such as JavaScript.

        <h3>#3 React has a strong community</h3>
        <div class="paragraph">
          Developers love React, and it shows in how strong the community around it is. React’s official website lists <strong>multiple thriving React communities</strong>, each with thousands of users who are happy to share their experience, give useful tips, and answer code-level questions.
